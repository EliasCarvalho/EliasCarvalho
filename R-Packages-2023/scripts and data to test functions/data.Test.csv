Abstract
"Background The grades of recommendation, assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) approach is widely implemented in systematic reviews, health technology assessment and guideline development organisations throughout the world. We have previously reported on the development of the Semi-Automated Quality Assessment Tool (SAQAT), which enables a semi-automated validity assessment based on GRADE criteria. The main advantage to our approach is the potential to improve inter-rater agreement of GRADE assessments particularly when used by less experienced researchers, because such judgements can be complex and challenging to apply without training. This is the first study examining the inter-rater agreement of the SAQAT. Methods We conducted two studies to compare: a) the inter-rater agreement of two researchers using the SAQAT independently on 28 meta-analyses and b) the inter-rater agreement between a researcher using the SAQAT (who had no experience of using GRADE) and an experienced member of the GRADE working group conducting a standard GRADE assessment on 15 meta-analyses. Results There was substantial agreement between independent researchers using the Quality Assessment Tool for all domains (for example, overall GRADE rating: weighted kappa 0.79; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.93). Comparison between the SAQAT and a standard GRADE assessment suggested that inconsistency was parameterised too conservatively by the SAQAT. Therefore the tool was amended. Following amendment we found fair-to-moderate agreement between the standard GRADE assessment and the SAQAT (for example, overall GRADE rating: weighted kappa 0.35; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.87). Conclusions Despite a need for further research, the SAQAT may aid consistent application of GRADE, particularly by less experienced researchers."
"BACKGROUND: Personalized cancer treatments depend on the determination of a patient's genetic status according to known genetic profiles for which targeted treatments exist. Such genetic profiles must be scientifically validated before they is applied to general patient population. Reproducibility of findings that support such genetic profiles is a fundamental challenge in validation studies. The percentage of overlapping genes (POG) criterion and derivative methods produce unstable and misleading results. Furthermore, in a complex disease, comparisons between different tumor subtypes can produce high POG scores that do not capture the consistencies in the functions. RESULTS: We focused on the quality rather than the quantity of the overlapping genes. We defined the rank value of each gene according to importance or quality by PageRank on basis of a particular topological structure. Then, we used the p-value of the rank-sum of the overlapping genes (PRSOG) to evaluate the quality of reproducibility. Though the POG scores were low in different studies of the same disease, the PRSOG was statistically significant, which suggests that sets of differentially expressed genes might be highly reproducible. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluations of eight datasets from breast cancer, lung cancer and four other disorders indicate that quality-based PRSOG method performs better than a quantity-based method. Our analysis of the components of the sets of overlapping genes supports the utility of the PRSOG method."
"Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) have been widely used to recover gene regulatory relationships from time-series data in computational systems biology. Its standard assumption is 'stationarity', and therefore, several research efforts have been recently proposed to relax this restriction. However, those methods suffer from three challenges: long running time, low accuracy and reliance on parameter settings. To address these problems, we propose a novel non-stationary DBN model by extending each hidden node of Hidden Markov Model into a DBN (called HMDBN), which properly handles the underlying time-evolving networks. Correspondingly, an improved structural EM algorithm is proposed to learn the HMDBN. It dramatically reduces searching space, thereby substantially improving computational efficiency. Additionally, we derived a novel generalized Bayesian Information Criterion under the non-stationary assumption (called BWBIC), which can help significantly improve the reconstruction accuracy and largely reduce over-fitting. Moreover, the re-estimation formulas for all parameters of our model are derived, enabling us to avoid reliance on parameter settings. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the experimental evaluation of our proposed method on both synthetic and real biological data demonstrates more stably high prediction accuracy and significantly improved computation efficiency, even with no prior knowledge and parameter settings."
"Current experimental research in several scientific areas must deal with the issue of high dimensionality and complexity. In particular, experimental design strategies are hindered by the limited number of points that can be tested due to technical and economic constraints. In this paper we propose a novel approach called QueBN-design (Querying Bayesian network design) derived by coupling conditional probabilistic inference in Bayesian network models and evolutionary principles. As proof-of-principle, we evaluate the performance of our approach in a simulation study achieving very good results also in comparison with other commonly used designs. Further, we address the problem of engineering synthetic proteins, and in particular the 1AGY serine esterase protein. Also in this case results indicate that QueBN-design can effectively guide the search in very large experimental spaces testing a very limited number of points, outperforming other evolutionary and classical benchmark designs.

"A framework for the reliability evaluation of grid-connected PV (photovoltaic) systems with intermittent faults is proposed using DBNs (dynamic Bayesian networks). A three-state Markov model is constructed to represent the state transition relationship of no faults, intermittent faults, and permanent faults for PV components. The model is subsequently fused into the DBNs. The reliability and availability of three simple PV systems with centralized, string, and multistring configurations, as well as a complex PV system, are analyzed through the proposed framework. The sequence of the degree of importance of PV components is investigated using mutual information. The effects of intermittent fault parameters, including the coefficients of intermittent fault, permanent fault, and intermittent repair, on the reliability and availability are explored. Results show that the reliability and availability of the PV system with centralized configuration rapidly decrease, compared with those of the PV systems with string and multistring configurations. The sequence of the degree of importance of PV components is DC/AC inverter, DC/DC converter, DC combiner, and PV module arranged from the largest to the smallest. The finding indicates that the DC/AC inverter should be given considerable attention to improve the reliability and availability and to prevent their possible failures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Bayesian network (BN), a simple graphical notation for conditional independence assertions, is promised to represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Learning the structure of a Bayesian network classifier (BNC) encodes conditional independence assumption between attributes, which may deteriorate the classification performance. One major approach to mitigate the BNC's primary weakness (the attributes independence assumption) is the locally weighted approach. And this type of approach has been proved to achieve good performance for naive Bayes, a BNC with simple structure. However, we do not know whether or how effective it works for improving the performance of the complex BNC. In this paper, we first do a survey on the complex structure models for BNCs and their improvements, then carry out a systematically experimental analysis to investigate the effectiveness of locally weighted method for complex BNCs, e.g., tree-augmented naive Bayes (TAN), averaged one-dependence estimators AODE and hidden naive Bayes (HNB), measured by classification accuracy (ACC) and the area under the ROC curve ranking (AUC). Experiments and comparisons on 36 benchmark data sets collected from University of California, Irvine (UCI) in Weka system demonstrate that locally weighting technologies just slightly outperforms unweighted complex BNCs on ACC and AUC. In other words, although locally weighting could significantly improve the performance of NB (a BNC with simple structure), it could not work well on BNCs with complex structures. This is because the performance improvements of BNCs are attributed to their structures not the locally weighting."
"In violent crimes, adhesive tapes such as duct tape are often used by perpetrators e.g. to tie up a victim. In the forensic examination of such tapes many different types of traces can be found, such as finger marks and human biological traces. These traces are first interpreted at source level. However, even when it is certain that a trace was donated by the suspect this does not necessarily mean that he donated the trace while taping the victim, as he could have e.g. used the tape roll from which the pieces came previous to the crime. Therefore, the trace can also be interpreted at activity level. For this, factors such as transfer, persistence and recovery, as well as the position of the trace as it would have been on the original roll have to be taken into consideration. In this study, we have developed a Bayesian network which can aid the forensic practitioner in his interpretation. From a sensitivity analysis, we have concluded that it would be most desirable to set up further studies to determine the most likely positions of DNA on tape rolls if there has only been innocent contact."
"Identifying specific human body fluids and establishing their presence in traces can be crucial to help reconstructing alleged incidents in criminal cases. It is up to the forensic practitioner to test for the presence of body fluids, interpret the test results and draw scientifically supported conclusions that can be used in a court of law. This study presents a Bayesian network for the interpretation of test results for human saliva based on the presence of human salivary a-amylase. TheBayesian network can be used by forensic practitioners as an exploratory tool to form their expert opinion on the presence or absence of saliva in a trace."
"The Libra Toolkit is a collection of algorithms for learning and inference with discrete probabilistic models, including Bayesian networks, Markov networks, dependency networks, and sum-product networks. Compared to other toolkits, Libra places a greater emphasis on learning the structure of tractable models in which exact inference is efficient. It also includes a variety of algorithms for learning graphical models in which inference is potentially intractable, and for performing exact and approximate inference. Libra is released under a 2-clause BSD license to encourage broad use in academia and industry."
"Bayesian network classifiers are a powerful machine learning tool. In order to evaluate the expressive power of these models, we compute families of polynomials that sign-represent decision functions induced by Bayesian network classifiers. We prove that those families are linear combinations of products of Lagrange basis polynomials. In absence of V-structures in the predictor sub-graph, we are also able to prove that this family of polynomials does indeed characterize the specific classifier considered. We then use this representation to bound the number of decision functions representable by Bayesian network classifiers with a given structure."
"Background Psychosomatic health complaints are significant indicators of adolescent well-being. The aim of this study is to describe the full set of interactions between health complaints and the presence of subjective resources, represented by the quality of relationships with parents and peers and by a positive school perception, in a population of 15-year-old adolescents. Smoking and alcohol consumption were also included in the analyses. Methods Bayesian networks were built formales and females separately, in order to understand the interactions among all considered variables in a representative sample of 16 018 Italian adolescents participating in the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children survey 2009-10. Results The resulting networks show that school is the crucial node linking adolescents' well-being with parents and peer relationships, as well as with smoking and alcohol consumption. Conclusions Adolescents' well-being, as well as the prevalence of typical risk behaviours, such as smoking and alcohol consumption, is mediated by the adolescents' academic stress. Therefore, public health interventions, to be effective, should consider addressing the school environment by making it a more inclusive environment promoting critical thinking and sense of belonging rather than just focusing on personal behaviours."
"Conceptual ecological models synthesize information about complex systems into simplified visual maps and can be used to prioritize system components for research or management attention. In this article, we introduce conceptual modeling methods that incorporate expert ratings about a suite of properties of system components, including assessment of the state of knowledge, the strength of ecological impact, and the state of management or research attention devoted to a given component. Quantitative ratings of the properties of system components are subsequently used to prioritize model components objectively for research or management attention. Two case studies, one on plankton-herring-baleen whale dynamics and one on Chinook salmon strategic research planning, are presented to illustrate techniques. For example, in the Chinook salmon case study, participants constructed a prioritization score that identified system components rated as high ecological impact, but low state of knowledge and low state of management or research attention. By addressing gaps in both knowledge and attention, participants implemented a strategy for research planning that complemented existing Chinook salmon research and management in the study region. The case studies demonstrated that conceptual ecological models could be completed successfully with an economy of time. Conceptual modeling has been implemented across a range of disciplines and provides a useful tool that natural resource management and research groups can use to organize collaborative efforts and communicate research-or management progress to stakeholders or funders."
"Risk assessment performs a critical decision support role in maintenance decision making. This is through assisting maintenance practitioners systematically identify, analyze, evaluate and mitigate equipment failures. Often, such failures are mitigated through formulating effective maintenance strategies. In asset maintenance, well-known risk assessment techniques include the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), and Bayesian Networks (BN). In recent years, considerable research attention has been directed towards improving existing techniques, often at the expense of a structured framework for selecting suitable risk assessment techniques. Often, several criteria influence the selection process. Moreover, the criteria are closely linked to specific organizational competencies that vary from one firm to another. In this study, a selection methodology for risk assessment techniques in the maintenance decision making domain is proposed. In the methodology, generic selection criteria for the FMEA, FTA and BN are derived based on the risk assessment process outlined in the ISO 31000:2009 standard. The criteria are prioritized using the Analytic Network Process (ANP), taking into account the judgment and opinion of academic and industrial domain experts. The results illustrate the usefulness of the proposed methodology towards assisting maintenance practitioners discern important competencies relevant to the specific technique and as such select the technique best suited for the organization.

"In the marine environment, humans exploit natural ecosystems for food and economic benefit. Challenging policy goals have been set to protect resources, species, communities and habitats, yet ecologists often have sparse data on interactions occurring in the system to assess policy outcomes. This paper presents a technique, loosely based on Bayesian Belief Networks, to create simple models which I) predict whether individual species within a community will decline or increase in population size, 2) encapsulate uncertainty in the predictions in an intuitive manner and 3) require limited knowledge of the ecosystem and functional parameters required to model it. We develop our model for a UK rocky shore community, to utilise existing knowledge of species interactions for model validation purposes. However, we also test the role of expert opinion, without full scientific knowledge of species interactions, by asking non-UK based marine scientists to derive parameters for the model (non-UK scientists are not familiar with the exact communities being described and will need to extrapolate from existing knowledge in a similar manner to model a poorly studied system). We find these differ little from the parameters derived by ourselves and make little difference to the final model predictions. We also test our model against simple experimental manipulations, and find that the most important changes in community structure as a result of manipulations correspond well to the model predictions with both our, and non-UK expert parameterisation. The simplicity of the model, nature of the outputs, and the user-friendly interface makes it potentially suitable for policy, conservation and management work on multispecies interactions in a wide range of marine ecosystems.

"Conformal predictors are usually defined and studied under the exchangeability assumption. However, their definition can be extended to a wide class of statistical models, called online compression models, while retaining their property of automatic validity. This paper is devoted to conformal prediction under hypergraphical models that are more specific than the exchangeability model. Namely, we define two natural classes of conformity measures for such hypergraphical models and study the corresponding conformal predictors empirically on benchmark LED data sets. Our experiments show that they are more efficient than conformal predictors that use only the exchangeability assumption."
